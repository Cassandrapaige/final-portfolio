This application was originally built using vanilla Javascript, but later refactored to use React hooks and styled components.

Styled components make it easy for us to pass props into our CSS so that we can render styles based on the users route parameters.

<Title>Accomplishments</Title>

I spent a good amount of time making all of the individual CSS examples and creating eye-catching color combinations that would excite the user.

Recently I created a copy-to-clipboard component, giving the user the added ability to copy the provided font-family and color-palette directly to their clipboard. By enabling this feature, we have greatly reduced the efforts required by the user, thus enhancing the overall user experience.

<Title isPurple>Future Improvements</Title>

I still have quite a few features I would like to add to this application. Number one being a homepage that explains in detail the applications overall purpose.

My main goal however, is to set up a back-end that allows users to create an account to showcase their work and receive feedback from other developers. This is a feature that I will implement in the future as I expand my experience to working with back-end technologies like Mongo and Express.
