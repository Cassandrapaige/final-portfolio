This project receives data from multiple API endpoints, making React a good choice as it gives us the added abililty to manipulate state without having to re-render our pages.

<Title>Project Purpose</Title>

As I have personally used this application every day since the beginning of the virus, I wanted to create a site that was both visually appealing and informative. The built-in search component and the ability to filter data based on number of cases make this application particularly helpful.

<Title isPurple>Problems</Title>

I ran into a few issues regarding the APIs for this project so code management was key to this applications success. Recently the News API made some changes to their liberties regarding free developer keys, so I migrated this project over to use the Guradian API, making minor tweaks to the code structure to keep the application in working order.
